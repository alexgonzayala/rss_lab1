And I hold within my hand
And I hold within my hand
Take this kiss upon the brow!
I stand amid the roar
That my days have been a dream;
While I weep--while I weep!
Is but a dream within a dream.

And I hold within my hand
Through my fingers to the deep,
Is it therefore the less gone?
Is it therefore the less gone?
I stand amid the roar
Thus much let me avow--
O God! can I not save
Grains of the golden sand--
Take this kiss upon the brow!
