All that we see or seem
Them with a tighter clasp?
In a night, or in a day,
O God! can I not grasp
How few! yet how they creep
You are not wrong, who deem
You are not wrong, who deem
While I weep--while I weep!
Is it therefore the less gone?
Them with a tighter clasp?
But a dream within a dream?Of a surf-tormented shore,
Them with a tighter clasp?
Thus much let me avow--
But a dream within a dream?Is all that we see or seem
How few! yet how they creep
O God! can I not save
O God! can I not grasp
O God! can I not save
